Coding style
============
We use the GIMP coding style in this project.

The GIMP coding style is defined as follows:

* There's a single space between the function name and the opening
  paren.
* Function names are lowercase, words separated by underscores.
* Macros and enums are all uppercase, words seperated by
  underscores.
* Types are all words capitalized, no separators between words.
* All functions in header files need to be prototyped.
* Indentation rules are GNU coding style, in particular:
  * 2 characters indentation level
  * Do not use tabs (of course your editor can accept the TAB key
    as a command, typically to indent the current line properly
    or to add spaces at the cursor until the next multiple of 8
    columns, but it should not put TAB characters in the file).
  * When editing files that still have TABs in them, make sure your
    editor interprets the TABs correctly, that is, has tab stops
    at 8 column intervals.
  * Opening braces are on a new line and indented one level.
  * Function header have the return type on one line, the name
    starting in the first column of the following line. All
    parameters are prototyped and there's a new line for each.
